Objective: 

	Build an AI agent to play a 5x5 version of the Go game called Little-Go. The agent competes against pre-defined AI agents using techniques like Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Q-Learning.

Key Features:

	Implements rule-based strategies for stone placement, capturing, and game-winning criteria.

	Supports reinforcement learning for strategy optimization.

	Designed for real-time performance within predefined time constraints.

Grading:
	
	Agents are evaluated through matches against Random, Greedy, Aggressive, Alpha-Beta, and Championship players.
